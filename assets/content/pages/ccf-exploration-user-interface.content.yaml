    The CCF Exploration User Interface (EUI) represents data across multiple scales, supporting navigation by multiple coordinate systems, including spatial, physiologic, and organ-based browsing. The first proof-of-concept user interface for the CCF v1.0.0 became available in June 2020. The EUI continues to evolve as more data becomes available. The CCF EUI code is available on <a href = "https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/ccf-ui">GitHub</a>.
