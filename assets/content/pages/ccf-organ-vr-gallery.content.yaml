    The Human Reference Atlas (HRA) Organ Gallery is a virtual reality (VR) application that allows users to explore 3D organ models of the HRA in their true size, location, and spatial relation to each other. Our focus is on two specific use cases: 1) introducing novice and expert users to the HuBMAP data available via the HuBMAP Data Portal, and 2) providing quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) for HRA data providers. In Figure 1, we compare the user interface for exploring the HRA via the Exploration User Interface (EUI) (Börner et al., 2022) to how it appears in the HRA Organ Gallery when using a Meta Quest Pro

   The HRA effort (Börner et al., 2021) led by HuBMAP (HuBMAP Consortium et al., 2019) is a close collaboration across 17 international consortia to map the adult healthy human body at single-cell resolution. The HRA project includes three main categories of data:
   Biological structure data that presents the connection between anatomical structures (AS) within human organs, the cell types (CT) located in them, and the biomarkers (B) that identify them
   Spatial data that defines entities inside a 3D reference system
   Specimen data that describes donors in terms of their demographic and health markers, such as age, sex, ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI)
   The ASCT+B tables, which describe the cell types and biomarkers typically found in human anatomy, are compiled by experts to capture biological structure data.

    If viewed in desktop applications, the spatiality and dimensionality of the 3D reference organs is lost while viewing the biological structure and specimen data is easily possible via information visualization. However, virtual reality (VR) 
    provides a unique method of visualizing and interacting with these diverse types of data in a unified environment. In addition, if viewed in VR, the spatiality of the organs is preserved and empowered through immersion, 
    see Figure 2. The HRA Organ VR Gallery also builds on and implements Bowman et al.'s concept of Information-Rich Virtual Environments (IRVEs)[2].

    The HRA Organ VR Gallery will feature interactive stacked bar graphs, which users will be able to use to view tissue blocks in their spatial and anatomical context, select cell types across anatomical structures, and get cell type distributions, 
    see Figure 3. Techniques such as brush-and-linking, highlighting, and hovering will be implemented for VR controllers to allow users to interact with the data. 
    The HRA Organ VR Gallery presents a tested implementation of classic 2D visualizations within a 3D virtual environment, ultimately enriching the analysis experience with presence and immersion while preserving the spatiality of biological data.
