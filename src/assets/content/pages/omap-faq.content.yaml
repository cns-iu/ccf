    ### What is an OMAP?

    OMAPs are combinations of antibodies that define cell populations, cell states, and anatomical structures reproducibly in diverse human tissues using multiplexed antibody-based imaging. Each OMAP is tailored to a tissue and/or organ of interest (e.g., kidney, lymph node), 
    multiplexed imaging method (e.g., IBEX, CODEX), and tissue preservation method (e.g., fixed frozen, FFPE). The OMAP initiative emerged from the Affinity Reagents Working Group within the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) 
    Consortium and parallel efforts in the field of cytometry to construct peer reviewed Optimized Multicolor Immunofluorescence Panels (OMIPs).

    <br><br>(2) OMAP Description Document that includes a brief description of the OMAP, links to relevant protocols and publications, and details related to antigen retrieval conditions and image analysis workflows, if applicable;
    <br><br>(3) an Antibody Validation Report (AVR) for each antibody included in your OMAP as outlined on the <a href="https://avr.hubmapconsortium.org/" target="_blank">HuBMAP AVR website</a> (HuBMAP membership for Globus login is required); and
    <br><br>(4) a link to dataset(s) employing your OMAP via a public data repository (Zenodo) or the <a href="https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/" target="_blank">HuBMAP data portal</a>.

    <div id="must-i-be-a-member-of-the-human-biomolecular-atlas-program-hubmap-to-author-an-omap">
    <strong>Must I be a member of the Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) to author an OMAP?</strong>
    <br>No, OMAP authors do not need to be affiliated with HuBMAP. Our initial set of OMAPs were authored by members of several consortia, including the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), Human Cell Atlas (HCA), and LungMap. We additionally welcome contributions from industry leaders and technology developers in the spatial biology field.

    <strong>Should I include antigen retrieval conditions for OMAPs designed for Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) specimens?</strong>
    <br>Yes. Please include the method (buffer, temperature, device used for antigen retrieval) in the OMAP Description Document. Please include links to relevant protocols in the OMAP Description Document and OMAP Table. For an example, see

    <div id="how-do-i-report-the-use-of-unconjugated-primaries-detected-with-secondary-antibodies">
    <strong>How do I report the use of unconjugated primaries detected with secondary antibodies?</strong>
    <br>For unconjugated primary antibodies, specify which fluorophore in the 'conjugate' field of the OMAP Table and include “secondary detection,” e.g., “Cy3 secondary detection.” For secondary antibodies leave the following fields blank: uniprot_accession_number, HGNC_ID, and target_name. 
    In the 'rationale' field, please state “Used for detection of (insert unconjugated primary antibody here).” For examples, please see
    <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-releases/v1.2/docs/omap/omap-skin-celldive.html" target="_blank">Skin Cell DIVE OMAP, specifically UCH-L1 primary antibody and Cy3 secondary antibody</a>.

    <strong>How do I report antibodies used for non-cyclic, non-fluorescent based methods such as imaging mass cytometry?</strong>
    <br>Please list the metal conjugates used in the 'conjugate' field of the OMAP Table and list “1” for cycle number. For example of how to report non-cyclic imaging methods employing metal-labeled antibodies, please see 
    <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-releases/v1.2/docs/omap/omap-liver-sim.html" target="_blank">Liver SIMS OMAP</a>.

    <strong>How do I report the use of custom reagents conjugated in house or purchased from a vendor?</strong>
    <br>Please include the catalog number for the unconjugated antibody and specify "unconjugated,” e.g., “338502 (Unconjugated).” Under 'conjugate' field, list the fluorophore, specify “custom,” and add the conjugation kit catalog number, if applicable. For examples, 
    please see <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-releases/v1.2/docs/omap/omap-lymph-node-ibex.html" target="_blank">Lymph Node IBEX OMAP</a>. Additionally, please create

    <strong>Should I include an OMAP in my manuscript that uses multiplexed antibody-based imaging?</strong>
    <br>We strongly recommend that you format your antibody panel using the <a href="https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf/pages/omap-extras/omap-table-template.xlsx" target="_blank">OMAP Table Template</a>. 
    The metadata captured by our OMAP template conform to journal reporting standards and are recommended for reproducible multiplexed tissue imaging

    <div id="as-an-omap-author-who-has-published-my-omap-with-a-peer-reviewed-journal-why-should-i-also-publish-my-omap-on-the-hubmap-hra-portal">
    <strong>As an OMAP author who has published my OMAP with a peer reviewed journal, why should I also publish my OMAP on the HuBMAP HRA Portal?</strong>
    <br>By publishing OMAPs on the HuBMAP HRA portal, we aim to highlight useful resources that may be missed in the methods and supplementary tables of most manuscripts. 
    We appreciate the time and dedication it takes to construct an OMAP de novo and hope that the HuBMAP HRA Portal will provide greater visibility for your work while helping others with their multiplexed imaging studies.
    </div><br>
    <div id="do-omaps-need-to-accompany-published-work-featuring-multiplexed-antibody-based-imaging">
    <strong>Do OMAPs need to accompany published work featuring multiplexed antibody-based imaging?</strong>
    <br>No, we will accept OMAPs created for ongoing work as long as authors provide links to publicly available protocols, preprints, and datasets, e.g., protocols.io, bioRxiv, and Zenodo. These requirements help facilitate external review of OMAPs and cultivate community confidence in OMAPs. 
    We welcome unpublished OMAPs authored by industry leaders as long as relevant protocols and representative datasets are provided.
    </div><br>
    <div id="can-i-make-changes-to-an-existing-omap">
    <strong>Can I make changes to an existing OMAP?</strong>
    <br>Once published on the HuBMAP HRA Portal we cannot support major changes to an existing OMAP. In certain circumstances, we will accept revised OMAPs that correct minor changes such as typos. 
    However, please carefully review your OMAP before submission. You can expand on your existing OMAP - see Can I expand upon an existing OMAP?
    </div><br>
    <div id="can-i-expand-upon-an-existing-omap">
    <strong>Can I expand upon an existing OMAP?</strong>
    <br>Yes, please cite the original OMAP as a foundation and detail changes in the OMAP Description Document, e.g., additional antibodies included, alternative clones used, changes to the order in which antibodies are applied (if applicable), or conjugation kits used. 
    Additionally, the OMAP may be designed for a different sample type (e.g., FFPE if the original is for fixed frozen) or health state (e.g., aging, malignancy if the original is for a healthy adult). 
    In the latter example, the new OMAP must describe the unique cell types and cell states not covered by the existing OMAP for that tissue or organ. The expanded OMAP will receive a new number ID and DOI.
    </div><br>
    <div id="are-omap-revisions-versioned">
    <strong>Are OMAP revisions versioned?</strong>
    <br>Yes, if an existing OMAP has minor revisions to correct small changes to formatting or typos. Versioning is done through the GitHub repository for Human Reference Atlas (HRA) release. The OMAP maintains its original OMAP ID (Example: OMAP-1).
